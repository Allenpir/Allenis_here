<p>
  My name is Mohammad Amin Pirmoradian , here every one calls me Allen so can do the same . 18th of March is my birthday so I just turned 28 years old , I was borned in Iran , I left Iran when I was 24 and Lived in Greece for one year and a half, after that I lived in Sweden for three month , then I lived in Germany for 2 years and a half, now Im living in UK and Im planning to stay here . Heres list of the countries I've visited for short period of time : 1_ Russa 2_ Iraq 3_ Georgia 4_ Armenia 5_ Dubai (United Arab Emirates) 6_ Turky 7_ Ukrain 8_ Azerbijan 9_ Greece 10_ Serbia 11_ Macedonia 12_ France 13_ Gremany 14_ Netherlands 15_ Sweden 16_ Denmark 17_ Belgium 18_ UK 19 _Iran .<br>
  I came to UK on 1st of March 2022 and Live in London . <br>
  <br>
  I have studied physics in Iran for 3 years nut i left my country in rush so my bachelor remained unfinished after a while I started an other bachelor in greece at Webster University (American University) but I left greece after a year so that was an other dropped bachelor &#x1F622; unfortunately . <br>
  <br>
  
  I love coding and Im gonna be a great decent developer ; love it , Im planning to work hard every day and then get a job as a full stack developer and create so many beautiful websites . its very amazing what you can do with coding .
  if you think about it for a minute it would amaze you for sure . for instance : the 4th biggest company on the planet 'Amazon' functions through its website , Google , Youtube , Facebook , Ebay , Paypal and so on... , the list can continue for ever .
all the companies in the world share their stocks and you can buy them just through your laptop or your cell phone , 
the value of cryptocurrency is about 7% of all the money that exist in the world which works through internet .
  long story short everything goes through internet and it makes me so excited and looking forward to learn coding , Especially if you have good ideas in your mind . 

 I want to become a full stack developer because full stack developer is a person who can build the entire website ( back end and front end) all by himself. I want to be capable of building the entire website and do graet things .<br>
  <br>
  Of course money is very big motivation and developers make very good money so you can have a nice life especially if you work for many years and gain a lot of experience . <br>
